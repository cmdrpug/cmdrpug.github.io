          Hi my name is Logan and welcome to my introduction page. I am a senior
          at PSU and have enjoyed my time so far in the computer science and
          music programs.
          <span id="tank-text">I LOVE MY DOG TANK!</span>
          You can read more about my work experience in the next section.

        <h1 class="sectionHeader">PREVIOUS WORK</h1>
        <p class="text-body">
          I am hoping to graduate PSU this year. I have interned as a full stack
          dev working on developing features with new JavaScript APIs. Some
          projects I've worked on in school that aren't included on this site
          are: reading and improving a calculator codebase in typescript,
          creating a red-black tree for a database in java, and writing a sudoku
          solver in python.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body">
          I have also worked as a professional musician before coming to PSU. I
          still play the odd gig but its more for enjoyment than money for me
          now. I spend most of my time with music trying to write for and learn
          other instruments. I am working on an album on and off where I play
          everything which is something I've dreamed of doing for about a decade
          now since I started doing music stuff.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body">
          I would love to work in game development, although I'm a bit worried
          by some of the stories I've from devs in that field. Other than that,
          I want to expand my skillset in ways that might help with a future
          game-dev job and expand my abilities working with a team.

        <h1 class="sectionHeader">PROJECTS</h1>
        <p class="text-body">
          In this section I have 3 projects to show off from my time at PSU. One
          repository and two papers. While it's a bit of a shame I don't have
          more public work I can call on for this showcase, I know that write
          good documentation is just as important as the code itself. I hope to
          present a well-rounded skill set in this section.

          <h2 class="sectionHeader">MACHINE LEARNING GROUP PROJECT</h2>
          <p class="project-text-body">
            This is the only project I worked on thats hosted on github as of
            now. It was a final project for a machine learning course I took
            last year. The project is based on Conway's game of life which
            follows a grid layout where each space is either on or off. The
            state of adjacent spaces changes how a space will act on the next
            turn. Our goal was to use multiple ML techniques to try and find
            stable seeds for the game. I worked on a neural network approach.

          <h2 class="sectionHeader">TECHNICAL WRITING SAMPLE</h2>
          <p class="project-text-body">
            This is my final paper for the technical writing course at PSU. The
            goal of the coourse was to learn about different aspects and rules
            of technical writing which would come together as a mock-proposal
            for new laptops. Throughout the term I researched and gathered pros
            and cons for my laptop candidates until I put all the work together
            into this paper.

        <div class="project-item">
          <h2 class="sectionHeader">ARGUMENTATIVE WRITING SAMPLE</h2>
          <p class="project-text-body">
            The last project I'm showcasing hear is one of the first papers I
            wrote in college. The assignment was to propose a solution to some
            social issue in the form of am appeal to the Supreme Court. I chose
            to write about womens experience working as professional musicians.
            This is because I have been in the field myself for a number of
            years and have intrest in making it as viable of a carrier as
            possible for everyone. I enjoyed this assignment much more than
            expected as I could relate it to my personal intrest and as a
            result, I think it's one of the best papers I've ever written.
